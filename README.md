# Data Science Practicum 2023

This Data Science course is taught at the Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, in the fall semester 2023/2024. My plan is to give 12 lectures, each focused on one ML technique and dataset. The emphasis will be on coding and practicing data science skills, rather than the theoretical background.

## Course Info

The course is still under development but you can see its [[2021]](https://github.com/simecek/dspracticum2021) and [[2020]](https://github.com/simecek/dspracticum2020) versions.

This year, we will -again- cover Convolutional Neural Networks, Transfer Learning, Transformers and NLP methods in Genomics for sure. We will be using Python for exercises and homeworks but it is ok to start with zero knowledge of Python under the condition you can code in other langugage (e.g. R).
