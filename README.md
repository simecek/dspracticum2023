# Data Science Practicum 2023

Welcome to the Data Science Practicum 2023 at the Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, during the fall semester of 2023/2024. This course aims to equip you with essential data science skills by delving into various machine learning techniques and datasets through 12 lectures. Rather than focusing solely on theoretical concepts, our emphasis will be on hands-on coding and practical applications.

## Course Info

While the course is still in development, you can refer to its previous versions from [[2021]](https://github.com/simecek/dspracticum2021) and [[2020]](https://github.com/simecek/dspracticum2020) to get an idea of the content and structure.

In the upcoming sessions, we will once again cover prominent topics like *Convolutional Neural Networks*, *Transfer Learning*, *Transformers* and *NLP methods in Genomics*. or the exercises and homework, we will predominantly use Python but it is ok to start with zero knowledge of Python under the condition you can code in other langugage (e.g. R).

Machine learning has witnessed significant developments in the last two years and we will take advantage of those advancements. Specifically, we will explore **diffusion models** (used by Stable Diffusion, DALLE and Midjourney) and **large language models** (behind LlamaChat, Bard, Claude and ChatGPT). Additionally, a key focus of this year's course will be on HuggingFace's **transformers** and **datasets** libraries, which have recently become powerhouses driving various neural network applications.
