* Recap from last lesson: neuron, dense NN, ...
* Image recognition, Fashion MNIST dataset
* Convolutional Neural Network:
  * convolution layer
  * flatten layer
  * dropout

**Practical exercises**:

* [Playing with Fashion MNIST](Fashion_MNIST.ipynb)
* [Convolution for b&w image](Convolution_for_pixel_image.ipynb)



**Assignment 02**:

* Play a bit with the CNN on Fashion MNIST dataset, drop link to your GitHub with notebook here https://forms.gle/meAFu5VmYb5D2mnw9
* **Optional bonus**:
  * Make a confusion matrix for your model
  * Draw the top 10 pictures where your model was least confident
  * Draw the top 10 pictures from the test set where your model was most confident but the prediction was wrong
