* Transformer architecture - training details
* Text classification
* Hyperparameter optimization
* Text generation

**Practical exercises**:

* Exercise 1: [Text classification: News articles](ds_practicum_ex1_text_classification.ipynb)
* Exercise 2: [Text classification: Genomic benchmarks](ds_practicum_exercise2_genomic_benchmarks.ipynb)
* Exercise 3: [Text generation](ds_practicum_ex1_text_generation.ipynb)


**Assignment 06**:

1. Try to increase the performance of the model from Exercise 1 and report your best results (e.g. you can apply some hyperparameter optimization).
- if you are not successful report what approaches you have tried and all of your results

2. Modify the code from Exercise 3 to generate text in format similar to Shakespeareâ€™s plays (e.g. https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiny_shakespeare).

3. Push code to your Github repository and send me the link (deadline 30.10. 8:00).
