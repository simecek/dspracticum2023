**Assignment 07**:

1. Choose a model and dataset and apply Feature Importance or SHAP on it.
2. Have a look at few examples and decide whether the model’s decision are correct - it is not making it’s prediction based on some artefact from the data.
3. Think about how 2) could be done automatically without manually looking at the specific cases (can it be done for your use case?).
